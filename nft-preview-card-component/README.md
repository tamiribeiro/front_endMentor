## 👩🏻‍💻 My process

- I started by rearranging my `index.html` file, adding semantic tags and visualizing the layout. I had the box-model concept in mind all along, and I thought I was organizing boxes inside of boxes.
- When I was satisfied with the organization, I moved on to styling with `css`. I started by organizing global variables and then I began styling box by box, until I had the complete layout and finished with the interactivity (hover property) and responsivity.

### 💻 Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### 🏆 What I learned

- Positions with CSS
- Fade in Overlay with Icon
- Transitions

### 💪🏻 Continued development

- I want to keep practicing some CSS properties, such as Flexbox and Grid.
